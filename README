Distributed Secure Meta-analysis

== Files
- data/Sub.txt.lnx.overest.csv  ln(x) result for over-estimates of n;
- data/Sub.txt.overest.time  Run time analysis for over-estimate;


== Note
- API for Alice and Bob has changed a little from original one (to config server and port to run socket)
- Check if current port available: lsof -i :3496  (3496 is port you desire)


== Bugfix
- Error when running multiple test cases (first case OK, following crash with NullPointerException);
